# Events Exercises

The aim of this exercise is to let you use your DOM events understanding to do some DOM manipulation.

 - Add the necessary code to show the content related to tabs.
   - Clicking each tab would show different content.
   - Clicking each tab would give it an active style, check `active` class and remove it from others.

 - Extra:
   - Pressing keyboard keys 1 to 4 should do same  effect as clicking.
   - Count how many times the user opened the 2nd tab `TWO`.
